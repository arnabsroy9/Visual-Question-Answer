# Visual Question Answer

This project leverages **transformers** for question answering based on an uploaded image. The **user interface (UI)** is built using **Gradio**, providing an easy-to-use platform for interacting with the system.

### Key Features:
- Upload an image.
- Ask a question related to the uploaded image.
- The system processes the input and returns an accurate answer.

### How It Works:
